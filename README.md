## SFMLUI(VUI) - Library for use with SFML

My take on some UI elements for use with sfml. Needs work. One of my first projects.

Elements in this library:
-Button
-Slider
-ScrollBar
-TextBox
-CheckBox
-Console overlay

Anyone interested can view, review, test, modify, just be respectful. Thanks❕❕❕
